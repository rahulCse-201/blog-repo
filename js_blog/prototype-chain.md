# Prototype 
     in js prototype is a basically object. prototype is basically contain the functionality  and method for  non- premitive data types. when we create object or array such type non primitive data type , create instance of these then functionality transefered to their instance by the prototype object. 
     all the methods and functions are stored in this prototype oject. 
     non premitive data type or class  only have access the  prototype but instance haven't access the prototype object. 
     After creating the instance , instance have prot object that refrence to parent prototype. that is called prototype chain
